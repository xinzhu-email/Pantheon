The project's webpage is here: https://rpy2.github.io/


# Installation

`pip` should work out of the box:

```bash
pip install rpy2
```

The package has optional depencies providing
specific functionalities not otherwise required to use the rest of rpy2.

For example, to be able to run the unit tests:
```bash
pip install rpy2[test]
```

To install all optional dependencies (numpy, pandas, ipython), use:

```bash
pip install rpy2[all]
```

The package is known to compile on Linux, MacOSX
(provided that developper tools are installed, and you are ready
figure out how by yourself). The situation is currently a little
more complicated on Windows. Check the issue tracker.

In case you find yourself with this source without any idea
of what it takes to compile anything on your platform, try first

```bash
python setup.py install
```


## Issues loading shared C libraries

Whenever R is in not installed in a system location, the system might not
know where to find the R shared library.

If `R` is in the `PATH`, that is entering `R` on the command line successfully starts
an R terminal, but rpy2 does not work because of missing C libraries, try the following
before starting Python:


```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(python -m rpy2.situation LD_LIBRARY_PATH)":${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```


# Documentation

Documentation is available either in the source tree (`doc/`),
or [online](https://rpy2.github.io/doc.html).


## Testing

`rpy2` uses `pytest`, with the plugin `pytest-cov` for code coverage. To
test the package from the source tree, either to check and installation
on your system or before submitting a pull request, do:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

For code coverage, do:

```bash
pytest --cov=rpy2.rinterface_lib \
       --cov=rpy2.rinterface \
       --cov=rpy2.ipython \
       --cov=rpy2.robject \
       tests
```

For more options, such as how to run specify tests, please refer to the `pytest`
documentation.
